Which test do you want to run?
  1. Semaphore
  2. Channel
  3. Bound Channel
  4. Mutex
  5. Latch
  6. Barrier
  7. Light Switch
  8. Exchanger
  9. Active Object
 10. Semaphore FIFO
 11. Reader-Writer Lock
  Q. Quit
Enter: Light Switch test
==============================

A group of 5 threads will use the light switch to gain access from the permission semaphore, then another thread will attempt to gain access directly from the permission sempahore. This test will demonstrate that this individual thread will have to wait until all the threads using the light switch have released the permission.
