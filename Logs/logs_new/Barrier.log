Enter: Barrier test
==============================

Barrier size: 4
Split visitor thread groups will start every 4 seconds
We'll be testing 6 groups of the barrier size.
Note how threads may arrive at the barrier at any time, but threads of a new group can only begin entering the barrier once it is empty.

Legend:
- A -- thread has just arrived at the barrier (now waiting to enter it)
- E -- thread has just entered the barrier (now waiting to leave it)
- L -- thread has just left the barrier
- L* -- thread has left the barrier as the captain for the group
